# hello-circleci

This little web application doesn't know whether it's coming or going. 

This is a simple web application where clicking the button changes the message shown. Built with HTML and JavaScript and tested with Cypress. 

This never-ending conversation uses CircleCI to run automated tests. 


Starting off with a warm welcome
